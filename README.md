## Overview

The Next-Generation ESP32 Railway Automation System is a sophisticated IoT solution built on the ESP32 microcontroller. It automates railway crossing operations with train detection, gate control, and a robust security system, while offering a web-based interface for real-time monitoring. An independent servo supports tasks like solar panel cleaning, and the system is designed for modularity, allowing LEDs and buzzers to be replaced with advanced actuators like motors or relays. With WiFi connectivity and email notifications, it integrates seamlessly into IoT ecosystems, making it ideal for urban railway crossings, model train setups, educational projects, and industrial automation.

## Features

- **Train Detection**: Four NPN NO sensors (A, B, C, D) detect train presence and direction (e.g., A→B, C→Gate).
- **Gate Control**: Two servos automatically open/close gates, with customizable actuators (LEDs, buzzers, or advanced alternatives) for alerts.
- **Security System**: A dedicated sensor triggers alarms (LEDs, buzzers, or other actuators) and email notifications for tampering detection.
- **Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring of system status, sensor readings, gate status, security alerts, and servo positions via a responsive web server.
- **Independent Servo**: Automated movement for tasks like solar panel cleaning, with customizable cycles.
- **Modular Design**: Supports replacement of LEDs/buzzers with advanced actuators (e.g., motors, relays) and additional sensors.
- **IoT Integration**: WiFi-enabled for remote monitoring and email alerts, with potential for cloud and home automation integration.
- **Sensor Health Monitoring**: Detects stuck sensors (active >300 seconds) to ensure reliability.

## Applications

- **Urban/Rural Railway Crossings**: Enhances safety with automated gate control and real-time monitoring.
- **Model Train Setups**: Provides realistic automation for hobbyist train systems.
- **Educational Projects**: Demonstrates IoT, embedded systems, and sensor/actuator integration for learning.
- **Industrial Automation**: Adaptable for sensor-based control in factories or smart agriculture.
- **Smart City Infrastructure**: Integrates with IoT networks for centralized urban monitoring.

## Usage

### Operation

- **Train Detection and Gate Control**: Sensors A, B, C, D detect trains. When a train is detected at A or B, gates close, activating the gate buzzer (pin 15) and LED (pin 14). Gates open 5 seconds after the train clears.
- **Security System**: The security sensor (pin 26) triggers alarms (LEDs on pins 27, 32; buzzer on pin 33) and sends an email if tampering is detected and WiFi is connected.
- **Independent Servo**: The servo (pin 25) moves between 0° and 180° every 5 seconds, ideal for solar panel cleaning or similar tasks.

### Web Interface

- Open the Arduino IDE serial monitor (115200 baud) to find the ESP32’s IP address (e.g., "WiFi connected! IP: 192.168.1.100").
- Navigate to `http://<IP_ADDRESS>` in a web browser on the same network.
- The interface displays:
  - **System Status**: Overall status (e.g., "System Ready"), uptime, and WiFi connection.
  - **Gate System**: Gate status (Open, Closed, Opening Soon), train direction, and actuator states.
  - **Security System**: Security status (Normal, ALARM), email alert status, and alarm state.
  - **Sensor Status**: Real-time readings for sensors A, B, C, D, and security sensor.
  - **Independent Servo**: Position and movement status (MOVING or PAUSED).

## Customization

- **WiFi and Email Settings**: Update `ssid`, `password`, `SENDER_EMAIL`, `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD`, and `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` in the code.
- **Timing Adjustments**: Modify variables like `WIFI_RETRY_INTERVAL` (WiFi reconnection, default 30s), `IND_PAUSE_DURATION` (servo pause, default 5s), or `ALARM_OFF_DELAY` (alarm deactivation, default 2s).
- **Pin Assignments**: Reassign pins for sensors, LEDs, buzzers, or servos, ensuring ESP32 compatibility.
- **Replacing Actuators**: Swap LEDs/buzzers for advanced actuators:
  - **Relays**: Use for high-power devices (e.g., lights, sirens). Connect to a free GPIO pin and update `digitalWrite` calls.
  - **Motors**: Add DC or stepper motors for complex gate mechanisms, using libraries like `Stepper.h`.
  - **Additional Servos**: Assign new pins and create new `Servo` objects in the code.

## Advanced Features and Integrations

### Expanding the System

The ESP32’s multiple GPIO pins enable significant expansion:
- **Additional Sensors**: Add sensors (e.g., E, F) for longer tracks or environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity).
- **More Actuators**: Control additional gates, barriers, or devices using relays, motors, or servos.
- **Camera Integration**: Add an ESP32-CAM for visual monitoring of trains or security events.
- **Display Integration**: Use an OLED display (e.g., SSD1306) for local status updates.

### IoT Integrations

- **MQTT Protocol**: Use [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) to send data to a broker (e.g., Mosquitto) for remote monitoring.
- **Home Automation**: Integrate with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) to control lights or alarms based on train detection.
- **Cloud Services**: Log data to [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com) or [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com) for visualization and analytics.

### Power Management

- **Low Power Mode**: Implement ESP32 deep sleep (`esp_deep_sleep_start()`) when idle to save power.
- **Solar Power**: Use solar panels with a battery and charging circuit, leveraging the solar panel cleaning servo.

### Scalability

- **Multi-ESP32 Networks**: Deploy multiple ESP32s for larger railway systems, communicating via WiFi or MQTT.
- **Centralized Control**: Use a central server to coordinate multiple ESP32s for synchronized operations.

### Future Developments

- **Predictive Analytics**: Analyze sensor data to predict train arrivals and optimize gate timing.
- **Machine Learning**: Deploy lightweight ML models (e.g., via TensorFlow Lite) for train classification or maintenance prediction.
- **Voice Control**: Integrate with [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com) or [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa) for voice-activated status checks.
- **Augmented Reality**: Develop an AR app to visualize train positions and gate statuses.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                     | Possible Cause                     | Solution                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WiFi Not Connecting**   | Incorrect SSID/password or range   | Verify `ssid` and `password`. Ensure ESP32 is within WiFi range.         |
| **Sensors Not Working**   | Loose connections or faulty sensors| Check wiring (INPUT_PULLUP). Test with a multimeter.                     |
| **Servos Not Moving**     | Insufficient power or obstructions | Verify power supply (5V, 2A). Check for physical blocks.                 |
| **Email Not Sending**     | No internet or wrong credentials   | Confirm WiFi connection. Verify email settings and app password. Check serial monitor. |
| **Web Interface Not Loading** | Incorrect IP or server issue     | Confirm IP in serial monitor. Ensure ESP32 is powered and networked.     |

## Maintenance

- **Firmware Updates**: Re-upload code via Arduino IDE to add features or fix issues.
- **Log Monitoring**: Use the serial monitor (115200 baud) for debugging and status updates.
- **Hardware Checks**: Regularly inspect sensor and actuator connections for wear or loose wiring.
- **Power Optimization**: Monitor power consumption and consider low-power modes for battery operation.

## Security Considerations

- **Web Interface**: Accessible on the local network without authentication. Add [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) with authentication for enhanced security.
- **Email Security**: Use a dedicated email account for notifications to avoid compromising personal accounts.
- **Physical Security**: Ensure the security sensor is tamper-proof and properly calibrated.

## Testing

- **Sensors**: Trigger each sensor manually (e.g., by shorting) and verify LED responses and system actions.
- **Servos**: Confirm gate servos (pins 13, 12) open/close on train detection and the independent servo (pin 25) cycles correctly.
- **Security System**: Disconnect the security sensor (pin 26) to test alarms and email notifications.
- **Web Interface**: Access the interface and verify real-time updates for all statuses.
